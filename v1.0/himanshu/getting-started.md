## Linking Pages

To reference other pages in your documentation, use `@` to start linking.

## Blocks

There are many in-page blocks that you can try which will make your documentation richer, just type {% key key=" /" /%}. Go have a look! ðŸ‘‡

### Code

You can write code by inserting the code block plugin either manually or by using markdown's syntax for fenced code block.

{% code %}
{% tab language="javascript" %}
console.log("Hello World");
{% /tab %}
{% tab language="python" %}
print("Hello World!")
{% /tab %}
{% tab language="go" %}
package main

import "fmt" 

func main() {
     fmt.Println("hello world")
}
{% /tab %}
{% /code %}

```
console.log("try this")
```

### Images & Videos

Do you see all the images here? They were uploaded by using the plugin! You can also embed YouTube videos.

## Sidebar

To your ðŸ‘ˆ, you will find the sidebar where you can set up your project and account settings, as well to add more versions and documentation.

## Logo and Colour

Up there ðŸ‘†, you can add navigation links, change the logo, favicon, as well as the main colour of your documentation (make sure it is colourful enough ðŸŒˆ).
