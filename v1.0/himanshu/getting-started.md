### Markdown

You can write markdown directly, and we'll transform it right away to what you are used to! ðŸš€

#### Code

You can write code by inserting the code block plugin either manually or by using markdown's syntax for fenced code block.

```
```



console.log("Hello World");



print("Hello World!")



package main

import "fmt"

func main() { fmt.Println("hello world") }

```
console.log("try this")
```
